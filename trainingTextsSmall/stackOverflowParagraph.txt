There are a wide variety of questions and answers on SO concerning detecting a single keypress or about detecting single character input, such as this one or this one, which both use some form of getch. I ve looked at the python curses library, and from what I can tell the primary form of key detection is also in the form of single character getch. But these do not detect the length of keypress Code the loop using GOTO, and for each iteration use SET X X to add yet another sign to an environment variable X; and to exit the loop, compare the value of with a string of or signs.
