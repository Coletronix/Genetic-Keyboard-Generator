# Genetic-Keyboard-Generator

An algorithm for generating keyboard layouts based on a fitness function

# Getting Started

To run the genetic algorithm, open a command line, and run `python GeneticAlgorithm.py` to run one instance, or `./launchMultiple.bat` to run five.

# Parameters

In the GeneticAlgorithm.py file, there are parameters for the genetic algorithm like tournamentSize. These can be changed to modify the parameters of the genetic algorithm.

# Fitness Function

The fitness function can be found in the KeyboardAgent.py file. Agents that return higher numbers for the fitness function do better in the crossover stage of the algorithm.
